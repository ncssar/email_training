# email_training
Email (and web page) trainings for the entire NCSSAR email list

This repo will not have any code - it's for discussion and listing of topics only.  One option is to make a new issue for each bite-sized email training idea.  It might be that a github repo is not the best place to keep track of these ideas - maybe a google docs folder would be better.  Anyway, this is just a place to start brainstorming.
