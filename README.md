# email_training
Email (and web page) trainings for the entire NCSSAR email list

This repo will not have any code - it's for discussion and listing of topics only.  One option is to make a new issue for each bite-sized email training idea.  It might be that a github repo is not the best place to keep track of these ideas - maybe a google docs folder would be better.  Anyway, this is just a place to start brainstorming.

Of course the content of each email and web page would have to be developed along with the team leader, or, at the very least, vetted with the team leader/s and possibly with Del before sending to the list.
